These features include: elastic and attenuation properties (Community Velocity Model, CVM), t<emperature (Community Thermal Model, CTM), rheology (Community Rheology Model, CRM), stress and stressing rate (Community Stress Model, CSM), deformation rate (Community Geodetic Model, CGM), and fault geometry (Community Fault Model, CFM). \n",

A more recent model, developed by a group at Harvard, called CVM-H was released in 2015. The CVM-H is composed of detailed basin velocity descriptions that are based on tens of thousands of direct velocity measurements and incorporate the locations and displacements of major fault zones that influence basin structure. These basin descriptions are used to develop tomographic models of crust and upper mantle velocity structure, which are subsequently iterated and improved using 3D waveform adjoint tomography. A geotechnical layer (GTL) based on Vs30 measurements and consistent with the underlying velocity descriptions is also included as an optional model component for specific applications via the UCVM.\n",
